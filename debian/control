Description: Loki storage server
 This package contains the Loki storage server component of a Loki service
 node.  This package requires a running lokid configured as a service node; the
 default configuration is suitable for the lokid configuration set up by the
 loki-service-node package, but it is possible to configure manually via the
 /etc/loki/*.conf files.
