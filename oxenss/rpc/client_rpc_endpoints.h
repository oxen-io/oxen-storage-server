/// - `expiry` (required, unless ttl given) the message's expiry time as a unix epoch milliseconds
///   timestamp.  (Unlike ttl, this cannot be passed as a stringified integer).
/// - `data` (required) the message data, encoded in base64 (for json requests).  Max data size is
///   76800 bytes (== 102400 in b64 encoding).  For OMQ RPC requests the value is bytes.
/// - `namespace` (optional) a non-zero integer namespace (from -32768 to 32767) in which to store
///   this message.  Messages in different namespaces are treated as separate storage boxes from
///   untagged messages.
///   Different IDs have different storage properties:

///     Currently in use or planned for use are 0 (DMs), -10 (legacy closed groups), 3 (future v2
///     closed groups), 5 (Session account private metadata).
///   - non-divisible-by-10 namespaces require authentication for all operations, including storage.
///   Omitting the namespace is equivalent to specifying the 0 namespace.
/// - `subaccount` (optional) if provided this is a 36-byte subaccount token (encoded as base64 or
///   hex in JSON requests), consisting of a 32-byte Ed25519 pubkey (typically blinded) and a byte
///   of permission bits governing the type of access the subaccount has for the account.  When
///   provided this must be paired with `subaccount_sig`, and the request `signature` value must be
///   produced using the private key associated with the subaccount pubkey rather than the main
///   account's pubkey.
///
///   When using a subaccount, the `store` method requires authentication with a subaccount token
///   with the `write` flag set.
/// - `subaccount_sig` (required when and only when `subaccount` present) this specifies a signature
///   of the `subaccount` bytes value, signed by the main account's private key, authorizing the
///   subaccount token to be used.
///
///
/// Authentication parameters: these are required when storing to a namespace not divisible by 10,
/// and must match the pubkey of the storage address.  If provided then the request will be denied
/// if the signature does not match.  Should not be provided when depositing a message in a public
/// receiving (i.e. divisible by 10) namespace.
///
/// - signature -- Ed25519 signature of ("store" || namespace || sig_timestamp), where namespace and
///   sig_timestamp are the base10 expression of the namespace and sig_timestamp values.  Must be
///   base64 encoded for json requests; binary for OMQ requests.  For non-05 type pubkeys (i.e. non
///   session ids) the signature will be verified using `pubkey`.  For 05 pubkeys, see the following
///   option.  This signature is produced by the private key associated with the account, unless
///   using the `subaccount`/`subaccount_sig` parameters.
/// - pubkey_ed25519 if provided *and* the pubkey has a type 05 (i.e. Session id) then `pubkey` will
///   be interpreted as an `x25519` pubkey derived from *this* given ed25519 pubkey (which must be
///   64 hex characters or 32 bytes).  *This* pubkey should be used for signing, but must also
///   convert to the given `pubkey` value (without the `05` prefix) for the signature to be
///   accepted.
/// - sig_timestamp -- the timestamp at which this request was initiated, in milliseconds since unix
///   epoch, used in the authentication signature.  Must be within Â±60s of the current time.  (For
///   clients it is recommended to retrieve a timestamp via `info` first, to avoid client time sync

///   namespace forms an independent message storage for the same address.  When specified,

///   namespace of 0.

///   stored.  Can also be specified as `lastHash`.  An empty string (or null) is treated as an

/// - `subaccount`/`subaccount_sig` (optional) see description in `store`.  Only subaccount tokens
///   with the read bit set may invoke this method.
/// - `max_count`/`max_size` (optional) these two integer values control how many messages to
///   retrieve.  `max_count` takes an absolute count; at most the given value will be returned, when
///   specified.  `max_size` specifies a maximum aggregate size of messages to return (in bytes, if
///   positive).  `max_size` may be specified as `-1` to indicate the maximum size supported in a
///   single network request (minus some overhead allowance); -2 indicates half the maximum size, -3
///   indicates 1/3 the maximum, etc.  Currently the maximum retrieval size is 7.8MB, but this could
///   change in the future.

///   When batching multiple retrieve requests together it is highly recommended to use a negative

///   namespaces then specify `"max_size": -5` on each of them to ensure that, if all are full, you
///   will not exceed network limits.
///
///   Alternatively, if some are expected to be larger than others, you could use different
///   fractions that add up to <= 1.  For example, -2 on a large mailbox (for 1/2 the limit) and
///   -10 on five smaller mailboxes so that that maximum returned data is 1/2 + 5*(1/10) = 1.
///
///   When both `max_count` and `max_size` are specified then the returned message count will not
///   exceed either limit.
///
///   When neither `max_count` nor `max_size` are specified then the request is equivalent to
///   omitting `max_count` and specifying `max_size` as -5 (i.e. return up to 1/5 of the network max
///   transmission size at a time).
///
///   Note that regardless of the two values the response will always include at least one message,
///   even if it would exceed the given maximum size.
