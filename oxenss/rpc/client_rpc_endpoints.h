/// - `timestamp` (required) the timestamp of the message in unix epoch milliseconds, passed as an
///   integer.  Timestamp may not be in the future (though a few seconds tolerance is permitted).
///   For backwards compatibility may be passed as a stringified integer.
/// - `ttl` (required, unless expiry given) the message's lifetime, in milliseconds, passed as a
///   string or stringified integer, relative to the timestamp.  Timestamp+ttl must not be in the
///   past.  For backwards compatibility may be passed as a stringified integer.
/// - `expiry` (required, unless ttl given) the message's expiry time as a unix epoch milliseconds
///   timestamp.  (Unlike ttl, this cannot be passed as a stringified integer).
/// - `data` (required) the message data, encoded in base64 (for json requests).  Max data size is
///   76800 bytes (== 102400 in b64 encoding).  For OMQ RPC requests the value is bytes.
/// - `namespace` (optional) a non-zero integer namespace (from -32768 to 32767) in which to store
///   this message.  Messages in different namespaces are treated as separate storage boxes from
///   untagged messages.
/// - `subkey` (optional) if provided this is a 32-byte subkey value, encoded base64 or hex (for
///   json requests; bytes, for bt-encoded requests), to use for subkey signature verification
///   instead of using `pubkey` directly.  Denoting this value as `c` and `pubkey` as `A`, the
///   signature verification will use public key value `D=(c+H(c‖A))A` to verify the request
///   signature instead of `A`.  `H(.)` here is 32-byte BLAKE2b with a key of the 12-byte ascii
///   string `OxenSSSubkey`. The client must therefore sign using `d=a(c+H(c‖A))`, where this `d`
///   value has been calculated and provided securely to the sub-user by an owner of the account
///   (i.e. someone with master secret key `a`).  Though `c` can be any cryptographically secure
///   32-byte value, it is recommended to use `c=H(A‖S)`, where `S` is the user's pubkey.
///
///   Different IDs have different storage properties:
///   - namespaces divisible by 10 (e.g. 0, 60, -30) allow unauthenticated submission: that is,
///     anyone may deposit messages into them without authentication.  Authentication is required
///     for retrieval (and all other operations).
///   - namespaces -30 through 30 are reserved for current and future Session message storage.
///     Currently in use or planned for use are 0 (DMs), -10 (legacy closed groups), 3 (future v2
///     closed groups), 5 (Session account private metadata).
///   - non-divisible-by-10 namespaces require authentication for all operations, including storage.
///   Omitting the namespace is equivalent to specifying the 0 namespace.
///
/// Authentication parameters: these are required when storing to a namespace not divisible by 10,
/// and must match the pubkey of the storage address.  If provided then the request will be denied
/// if the signature does not match.  Should not be provided when depositing a message in a public
/// receiving (i.e. divisible by 10) namespace.
///
/// - signature -- Ed25519 signature of ("store" || namespace || sig_timestamp), where namespace and
///   sig_timestamp are the base10 expression of the namespace and sig_timestamp values.  Must be
///   base64 encoded for json requests; binary for OMQ requests.  For non-05 type pubkeys (i.e. non
///   session ids) the signature will be verified using `pubkey`.  For 05 pubkeys, see the following
///   option.
/// - pubkey_ed25519 if provided *and* the pubkey has a type 05 (i.e. Session id) then `pubkey` will
///   be interpreted as an `x25519` pubkey derived from *this* given ed25519 pubkey (which must be
///   64 hex characters or 32 bytes).  *This* pubkey should be used for signing, but must also
///   convert to the given `pubkey` value (without the `05` prefix) for the signature to be
///   accepted.
/// - sig_timestamp -- the timestamp at which this request was initiated, in milliseconds since unix
///   epoch, used in the authentication signature.  Must be within ±60s of the current time.  (For
///   clients it is recommended to retrieve a timestamp via `info` first, to avoid client time sync
///   issues).  If omitted, `timestamp` is used instead; it is recommended to include this value
///   separately, particularly if a delay between message construction and message submission is

/// - "swarm" dict mapping ed25519 pubkeys (in hex) of swarm members to dict values of:

///       DATA is in bytes (not base64); and NAMESPACE is empty for namespace 0, and otherwise is

///     - "signature": signature of the returned "hash" value (i.e. not in decoded bytes).  Returned
///       encoded in base64 for JSON requests, raw bytes for OMQ requests.

/// - `subkey` (optional) allows retrieval using a derived subkey for authentication.  See `store`
///   for details on how this works.
/// - `max_count`/`max_size` (optional) these two integer values control how many messages to
///   retrieve.  `max_count` takes an absolute count; at most the given value will be returned, when
///   specified.  `max_size` specifies a maximum aggregate size of messages to return (in bytes, if
///   positive).  `max_size` may be specified as `-1` to indicate the maximum size supported in a
///   single network request (minus some overhead allowance); -2 indicates half the maximum size, -3
///   indicates 1/3 the maximum, etc.  Currently the maximum retrieval size is 7.8MB, but this could
///   change in the future.

///   When batching multiple retrieve requests together it is highly recommended to use a negative
///   value to avoid exceeding the network size limit: e.g. if retrieving from 5 different
///   namespaces then specify `"max_size": -5` on each of them to ensure that, if all are full, you
///   will not exceed network limits.
///
///   When both `max_count` and `max_size` are specified then the returned message count will not
///   exceed either limit.

/// - "body" -- the response value (usually a dict).

///
///     {"requests": [{"method": "foo", "params": {"z": 3}}, {"method": "bar", "params": {"z": 2}}]}

///   - `"height_at_least"` -- contains a blockchain height (integer); the "yes" branch will be

///   - `"hf_before"`, `"hf_before"`, `"height_before"` -- negations of the above "..._at_least"

///     branches.
///
///   If more than one key is specified then all given keys must be satisfied to pass the condition.
///   (That is: conditions are "and"ed together).
///
/// - A `"then"` key contains a single request to invoke if the condition is satisfied.  The request
///   itself is specified as a dict containing "method" and "params" keys containing the endpoint to
///   invoke and the parameters to pass to the request.  The given request is permitted to be

///
/// `"if"` is always required, and at least one of "then" and "else" is required: if one or the
/// other is omitted then no action is performed if that branch would be followed.
///

/// - "hf" -- the current hardfork version (e.g. [19,1])
/// - "v" -- the running storage server version (e.g. [2,3,0])
/// - "height" -- the current blockchain height (e.g. 1234567)
/// - "condition" -- true or false indicating the logical result of the `"if"` condition.
/// - "result" -- a dict containing the result of the logical branch ("then" or "else") that was
///   followed.  This dict has two keys:
///   - "code" -- the numeric response code (e.g. 200 for a typical success)
///   - "body" -- the response value (usually a dict).
///   If the branch followed was omitted from the request (e.g. the condition failed and only a
///   "then" branch was given) then this "result" key is omitted entirely.
///

///
/// Suppose HF 19.2 introduces some fancy new command "abcd" but earlier versions require executing
/// a pair of commands "ab" and "cd" to get the same effect:
