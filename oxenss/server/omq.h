    ///   - P -- an ed25519 pubkey underlying a session ID, in bytes (32 bytes).  The account
    ///     will be derived by converting to an x25519 pubkey and prepending the 0x05 byte.  The
    ///     signature uses *this* key, not the derived x25519 key.
    /// - S, T -- (optional) - subaccount signature (S) and token (T) for subaccount authentication:
    ///   T is the 36-byte subaccount token, and S is the 64-byte main account signature authorizing
    ///   that token.  See the subaccount description in the "store" RPC endpoint documentation for
    ///   more details.  Both keys must be given when doing subaccount auth, neither key otherwise.
    /// - n -- list of namespace ids to monitor for new messages; the ids must be valid (i.e. -32768
    ///   through 32767), must be sorted in numeric order, and must contain no duplicates.
    /// - d -- set to 1 if the caller wants the full message data, 0 (or omitted) will omit the data
    ///   from notifications.
    /// - t -- signature timestamp, in integer unix seconds (*not* milliseconds), associated with
    ///   the signature.  This timestamp must be within the last 2 weeks (and no more than 1 day in
    ///   the future) for this request to be valid.
    /// - s -- the signature associated with this message.  This is an Ed25519 signature of the
    ///   value:
    ///       ( "MONITOR" || ACCOUNT || TS || D || NS[0] || "," || ... || "," || NS[n] )
    ///   signed by the account Ed25519 key or subaccount key (if using subaccount auth):
    ///   - ACCOUNT is the full account ID, expressed in hex (e.g. "0512345...").
    ///   - TS is the signature timestamp value, expressed as a base-10 string
    ///   - D is "0" or "1" depending on whether data is wanted (i.e. the "d" request parameter)
    ///   - NS[i] are the namespace values from the request expressed as base-10 strings
    ///
    /// If the request validates then the connection is subscribed (for 65 minutes) to new incoming
    /// messages in the given namespace(s).  A caller should renew subscriptions periodically by
    /// re-submitting the subscription request (with at most 1h between re-subscriptions).
    ///
    /// The reply to the subscription request is either a bencoded dict or list of dicts containing
    /// the following keys.  In the case of a list of subscriptions in the request, the returned
    /// list will be the same length with the ith element corresponding to the ith element of the
    /// input.
    /// - success -- included on successful subscription and set to the integer 1
    /// - errcode -- a numeric error value indicating the failure.  Currently implemented are:
    ///   - 1 -- invalid arguments -- called for invalid data (e.g. wrong encoding, wrong value
    ///     type, or a missing required parameter)
    ///   - 2 -- invalid pubkey -- the given pubkey/session id is not a valid pubkey.
    ///   - 3 -- invalid namespace -- the namespaces provided are invalid (e.g. invalid value, not
    ///     sorted, or contains duplicates).
    ///   - 4 -- invalid timestamp -- the timestamp is not a valid integral timestamp, is too old,
    ///     or is in the future.
    ///   - 5 -- signature failed -- the signature failed to validate.
    ///   - 6 -- wrong swarm -- the given pubkey is not stored by this service node's swarm.
    /// - error -- included whenever `errcode` is, this contains an English description of the
    ///   error.
    ///
    /// Each time a message is received the service node sends a message to the connection with a
    /// first part (i.e. endpoint) of "notify.message", and second part containing the bt-encoded
    /// message details in a dict with keys:
    ///
    /// - @ -- the account pubkey, in bytes (33).  This is the actual account value, regardless of
    ///   which of `p`/`P`/`S` was used in the request.  (The dict key is a symbol so that it sorts
    ///   first in the encoded data).
    /// - h -- the message hash
    /// - n -- the message namespace (-32768 to 32767)
    /// - t -- the message timestamp (milliseconds since unix epoch), as provided by the client who
    ///   deposited the message.
    /// - z -- the expiry (milliseconds since unix epoch) of the message.
    /// - ~ -- the message data, if requested.
    ///
    /// Note: if the same connection submits multiple simultaneous subscriptions then the subsequent
    /// subscriptions add to earlier subscriptions.  This has some implications:
    ///
    /// - The caller only receives one notification on the connection for a matching message from
    ///   any of the matching subscription requests on that same connection.
    /// - All pubkey/subaccount/ed25519 pubkeys that access the same account are treated as the same
    ///   subscription.
    /// - The data key (`~`) will be present in a notification if *any* subscription request for the
    ///   same account on the same connection requested data.  Same a flag only expires when the
    ///   subscription itself expires, but, like namespaces, persists as long as the subscription is
    ///   renewed (even if the renewals no longer request data).
    /// - Subscription renewal will renew all subscribed namespaces for that connection.  This *may*
    ///   extend the subscription of some namespaces (e.g. if you subscribe to namespaces 0 and 1,
    ///   then stop subscribing to namespace 1 but keep renewing a subscription to ns 0 on the same
    ///   connection for the same account).
    ///
    /// Thus any code that is managing subscriptions for multiple end clients should take care to
    /// check the namespace/data values and only pass it on if actually desired by a client.
